/**
 * The advert encoder, in isolation.
 *
 * This exists because of a bug that reached production: the dialog opens
 * holding whatever is already on the seat, the house adverts are
 * percent-encoded SVG data URLs, and the publish path assumed base64. The
 * result was `atob` throwing "The string to be decoded is not correctly
 * encoded" into the page, in the browser's words rather than anyone's.
 *
 * So the cases below pair the two halves that were never tested together:
 * what `houseAdverts` actually produces, fed to the function that consumes it.
 *
 *   npm run test
