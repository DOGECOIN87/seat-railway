# SEAT AIRLINES — 24 s commercial

> [!NOTE]
> This is **Seat Airlines'** commercial, kept from the repository Seat Railway was copied from. It films the airliner and its voiceover is the airline's; it has not been remade for the railway.

Output: `out/seat-airlines-commercial-A.mp4` (primary) and `-B.mp4` (comparison order), 1920×1080, 30 fps, H.264 + AAC, −14 LUFS.

Everything runs from `commercial/` after `npm ci`. The app's dev server must be running in capture mode for captures:
`(cd .. && VITE_CAPTURE_MODE=1 npx vite --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000)`.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Re-capture a scene | `node capture/scenes/<intro\|splash\|hero\|deck\|seats\|advert\|hold\|climb\|altitudes>.mjs` (all: `sh capture/run-all.sh`), then `sh capture/conform.sh`. Add `--preview` for stills only. Prefix `SA_GL=gpu` to render on this machine's GPU (minutes rather than hours); without it, SwiftShader. Change no files in the repo while a capture runs: Vite reloads the page and the take fails. |
| Regenerate VO | `sh vo/generate.sh && python3 vo/verify.py` (update the `seconds` in `src/config/timeline.ts` if lengths change) |
| Swap music | Put the track at `public/audio/music.wav`; it enters at the splash, ducks under VO and hits at the cloud break (see `Commercial.tsx`) |
| Reorder scenes | Move a line in `ORDER_A` / `ORDER_B` in `src/config/timeline.ts` |
| Re-render | `sh render.sh` (renders A and B, loudness-normalises, writes the contact sheet) |

The intro is the client's animation (`assets/source/user-plane.mp4`, not in git) when it is present; otherwise `conform.sh` uses `intro.mjs`, the app's own airliner filmed outside.

Capture mode lives in the app at `src/capture/` and is compiled out of production builds (it needs both `VITE_CAPTURE_MODE=1` at build time and `?capture=1` in the URL).
