# Cards and sign-in

## Sign in once

Everything in the directory is behind one sign-in, so you are not asked to sign every time you read or send something.

1. Check in with your wallet — see [Connecting a wallet](../getting-started/connecting-a-wallet.md).
2. In the **Network** tab, press **Sign in**.
3. Your wallet shows this message — word for word as the shared server expects it, so it still names Seat Airlines and the cabin directory. Approve it:

```
SEAT AIRLINES
Sign in to the cabin directory.

This lets you publish your card, read your section, and send and
receive introductions for one day. It authorises no transaction.

wallet: <your address>
issued: <the time you pressed the button>
```

That opens a session for **24 hours**, shared by every tab of the site in that browser — sign in in one and the others pick it up. The directory is a room for holders: it opens only to a wallet that **holds the token**, and the session keeps working only while it still does.

**Sign out** ends the session straight away. Switching to a different wallet ends it too.

If the wallet never answers — its prompt was swiped away, or the app sent to the background — the **Sign in** button comes back on its own a few seconds after you return to the page, with a line saying so. Press it again.

## Publish your card

You need a seat to publish a card. Press **Publish a card** (or **Edit card**), fill in what your coach should see, and press **Publish card**.

| Field | Up to | Who sees it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name or company** | 80 characters | Every signed-in holder |
| **Role** | 120 characters | Every signed-in holder |
| **Email** | 254 characters | Your own section only |
| **Website** | 300 characters | Your own section only |
| **LinkedIn** | 300 characters | Your own section only |
| **X, Telegram, Discord, Linktree, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, GitHub** | One account each | Your own section only |

Every field is optional, and a field stops taking text at its limit. For Website and LinkedIn you can type just the address — `example.com` becomes `https://example.com`. On a phone, **Go** on the keyboard publishes the card as the button does, and **Cancel** leaves it as it was.

When the card is published, a line under it says so; if something is refused, the line says what and why.

For the social accounts, type your handle, `@handle`, or paste the link from your profile — all three are kept as the handle, and the card links to that network's page for it. Discord takes a username (shown as text, since Discord has no profile pages) or an invite link (`discord.gg/…`). An account that is not one on that network — a link to another site, a handle the network would not allow — is refused, and the card says which.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Your contact details are read by your own coach, and nobody else.** An email you publish from Business is readable by Business — not by the driver's cab, First Class, the Exit Row or Standard.
{% endhint %}

## Your card follows your wallet

A card is stored against your wallet, not your browser or your seat. It is there on any device you sign in from, and it moves up and down the train with you — as your seat changes, so does who can read your contact details. If you are out-held and lose your seat, you can still sign in and read introductions sent to you.

## Reading other cards

The roster lists every seated holder with their coach and seat. Select one to open their card. For a holder in another coach you see their name and role, and their contact details are withheld.

A holder who has not published a card is listed as _Holder_ and the first four characters of their address, with their coach's default role — _Train operations_, _Business development_, _Partnerships_, _Campaigns & growth_ or _Community_. Until you sign in, every card reads _Sign in to see contact details._
