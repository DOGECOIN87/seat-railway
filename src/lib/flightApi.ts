/**
 * What the aeroplane is doing, over the wire.
 *
 * The switches are the aircraft's rather than the browser's — see
 * `manualControls.ts` — so this is how a page finds out that somebody has
 * rolled it, and how the one wallet that may do so says to.
 *
 * ── Why this polls, and why it is cheap ───────────────────────────────────
 * Everything else the page reads is slow-moving: the holder list every ninety
 * seconds, the wall every minute, the weather every fifteen. This is not.
 * Somebody presses a switch and expects the aeroplane to roll, and a minute
 * of nothing happening reads as a broken button rather than as a poll
 * interval. So it is asked for far more often than anything else here.
 *
 * What keeps that from being expensive is that the answer is tiny and almost
 * always the same one. The record is five fields; the Worker holds it in a
 * warm snapshot so most reads never touch storage; and the response carries a
 * short `max-age`, so a browser asking again inside it is answered by its own
 * cache without a round trip at all.
