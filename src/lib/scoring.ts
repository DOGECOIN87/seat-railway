/**
 * How the landing's flight is scored, and how far a score can be believed.
 *
 * Both sides import this, the way they share the seating: the page to add
 * the points up while somebody flies, the Worker to decide whether a score
 * posted to the leaderboard could have been flown at all. One set of numbers
 * in one place, so the two cannot drift apart about what is possible.
 *
 * ── The score ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Before the engine goes, a tenth of a point per foot of the best height
 * reached. Reaching the blast altitude is worth a flat bonus, and reaching
 * it quickly is worth more: forty points for every second under a par of
 * seventy-five — for the whole 10,000 ft, and in proportion when the engine
 * goes early, so a fast climb pays the same by the foot. After that, the points are for staying in the air — a
 * hundred a second, and more for doing it well or dangerously: half again
 * with the wings within twenty degrees of level (which, on one engine, is
 * the skill), and double with the ground under five hundred feet (which is
 * the nerve). Both at once is two and a half times.
 *
 * ── What can be believed ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The game runs in the visitor's browser, so a score is a claim. The Worker
 * times every run itself, from the moment the controls are taken, and a
 * score cannot be more than that much time could have earned at the best
 * possible rate, after the fastest possible climb. That stops a made-up
 * number; it cannot stop somebody patient enough to wait out the time their
 * made-up number needs. It is a leaderboard for bragging, not for prizes.
