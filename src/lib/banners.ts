/**
 * The advertising surface.
 *
 * Every seat on the map is a square, and a square somebody has paid for is a
 * billboard. A holder who has a seat can put a 1:1 image on it; the map then
 * reads as a mosaic of them, with the best-placed ads in the front rows —
 * which is the point. Position is earned by holding, not bought, so the
 * inventory prices itself.
 *
 * The aspect ratio is enforced rather than requested: anything dropped in is
 * centre-cropped to a square and re-encoded, so no upload can stretch the
 * grid or blow up the payload.
 *
 * ── Where these live ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three sources, in increasing order of authority.
 *
 * `localStorage`, which is what an upload did when nothing else was
 * configured: the banner stayed in the browser that set it, and the UI said
 * so rather than implying the wall had changed for anyone else. That path is
 * still here and still correct, but it is no longer where a default build
 * lands — `workerBase.ts` names a Worker when no variable does.
 *
 *   VITE_BANNERS_API=https://…      self-serve, signed, keyed by wallet
 *   VITE_BANNERS_URL=https://….json curated, read-only, keyed by seat
 *
 * The API is the production path and the one holders use. Note what it is
 * keyed by: **the wallet, not the seat.**
 *
 * That is the decision this whole module turns on. Keying by seat would mean
 * the server had to know who holds seat 3A, which means re-deriving the
 * entire seat ladder server-side — the same ranking, the same cutoffs, the
 * same tie-breaks — and keeping that copy in step with this one forever.
 * Keyed by wallet, the server's only job is to prove you are the wallet you
 * claim to be. The page already knows which seat a wallet sits in, because
 * working that out is the thing the page does.
 *
 * It falls out better as product, too: get out-held and reseated from 3A to
 * 7C and your advert moves with you, because it was never attached to 3A.
 * Drop off the manifest entirely and it comes down on its own.
