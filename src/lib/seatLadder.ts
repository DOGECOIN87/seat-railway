/**
 * What your bag earns you.
 *
 * The premise says your seat is not a choice — it is what your holdings are
 * worth relative to everyone else's. Seats are handed out strictly by rank
 * from the manifest, and the manifest is finite, so the ladder is a queue
 * rather than a set of thresholds: passing a threshold you can then forget
 * about is not competitive, and having to out-hold the specific person in
 * front of you is.
 *
 * Each cabin is therefore a band of ranks. How many ranks it covers is simply
 * how many seats are in it, counted in the order the aircraft fills.
