/**
 * The cabin directory, over the wire.
 *
 * Holder cards and introductions used to be `localStorage`, which made both
 * of them fictions: a card existed only in the browser that typed it, so
 * nobody in your section could ever read one, and a sent introduction was
 * written to the *sender's* own storage and delivered to nobody. The UI said
 * "queued in this browser", which was true and was the whole problem.
 *
 * They are rows in the Worker's database now, so a card follows its wallet to
 * any browser and an introduction actually arrives.
 *
 * ── Signing in ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The advert wall signs every publish, because a publish is rare and pins one
 * exact image. The directory is read and written constantly, and a wallet
 * popup per action would be both unusable and a good way to teach people to
 * approve things unread. So the wallet signs once for a session and what
 * comes back is a bearer token good for a day.
 *
 * The token is the only thing this module keeps in `localStorage`, and it is
 * a credential rather than data: losing it costs a signature, and it is
 * scoped to the wallet that opened it, so switching wallets drops it.
 *
 * A session only opens for a wallet that holds the token, which is what makes
 * the directory a room for holders: the cards in it, contact details and all,
 * are never handed to anybody who has not bought their way into the cabin.
