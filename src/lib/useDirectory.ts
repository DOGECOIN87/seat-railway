     a ref that is only ever set false stays false for the rest of the page's
     life. That fixed the development case and left the one that actually bit:
     this panel renders inside a `<Suspense>` boundary, and when a boundary
     re-suspends React runs every effect's *cleanup* without unmounting
     anything. A signature approved in that window came back to a ref saying
     the component was gone, and the session was discarded — a token left in
     storage, the panel stuck on "Check your wallet…", and no way out of it
     but a reload.
  
     The guard was never buying anything either way: React 18 dropped the
     warning it was written for, because an update to a component that has
     genuinely gone is simply discarded. So it is gone, and every result below
     is allowed to land. */
