/**
 * What your seat entitles you to see.
 *
 * Cards and introductions themselves live in the Worker's database — see
 * `networkingApi.ts`. What is left here is the part that is nobody's to
 * store: which of them the page puts in front of you, read off the seat
 * ladder it has already worked out.
 *
 * This is the page's own filter, not the boundary — but it is the same rule.
 * The Worker computes the seating too now, in `worker/src/ladder.ts`, from
 * the very module this file re-exports, and refuses at the row what this file
 * declines to draw. That is the order the two belong in: the server decides,
 * and this decides what is worth putting in front of somebody, so that a
 * holder is not offered a card that will not open or a composer whose message
 * would come back refused.

/**
 * Who may read a card, who may read a conversation, and who may start one.
 *
 * All three live in `seating.ts`, because the Worker enforces them and the
 * two sides must be the same rule rather than two readings of it. Re-exported
 * here so the cabin components keep asking the module that is about access.
 *
 * `canMessage` was the last one still written out in this file, and being the
 * page's alone is exactly what kept it from being a rule: the composer was
 * hidden from everybody it did not cover, and `POST /messages` took their
 * message regardless. It is the same line as `canViewContact` now — if you
 * can read somebody's card you can introduce yourself to them — so writing it
 * out again here would be keeping a copy of a rule that is one function away.
