 * seat ladder — and every one of those used to reach for the environment
 * variable itself, which meant going live was a change in five files or a
 * settings page nobody could see from the code.
 *
 * `VITE_TOKEN_MINT` still wins where it is set, so a fork or a staging
 * deployment can point somewhere else without touching this. But the
 * committed value below is what production runs on, which makes going live a
 * one-line edit that reviews like any other change and deploys like any other
