/**
 * The overhead panel.
 *
 * Four lamps, and the only two states that matter: lit or dark. Every lamp
 * carries its state as text as well as colour — the glow is the flourish, not
 * the message.
 *
 * Advisories light in the page's blue. The two alarms take the colours every
 * flight deck gives them — amber for a caution, red for a warning — because a
 * lamp that means masks down must not look like a selected tab. Each alarm
 * also floods its whole key and pulses, so the urgency is in the amount as
 * well as the hue, and survives being printed, dimmed, or looked at by
 * someone who does not separate red from green.
 *
 * Each lamp is a key on the panel with its legend in a lens: dark, the lens
 * is smoked glass with the symbol just readable in it; lit, the light is
 * behind the symbol.
