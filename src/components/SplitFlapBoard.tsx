/**
 * The departure board.
 *
 * A split-flap display, the kind that still hangs over the gates in older
 * terminals. Every character is a drum of flaps hinged across its middle, and
 * changing one means the flaps falling one after another until the wanted one
 * is showing — so the cells finish at different times, letters nobody asked
 * for go past on the way, and the board settles a column at a time. That is
 * the whole reason anybody stops to watch one, so it is modelled rather than
 * faked with a cross-fade.
 *
 * It animates the way the instruments do: off refs, through one
 * requestAnimationFrame loop, with no React render per flap. Twenty drums each
 * turning several times a second would otherwise be hundreds of renders a
 * second of a component whose props never change.
 *
 * The board is a picture of words, not the words. It is hidden from assistive
 * technology, and whatever it sits in carries its text — a heading that read
 * out a different phrase on every visit, or half a letter mid-turn, would be
 * worse than a fixed one.
