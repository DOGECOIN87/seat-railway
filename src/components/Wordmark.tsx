 * The railway's wordmark: the mark, and the name beside it on one line in
 * Montserrat's heaviest capitals, half the mark's height and centred on it
 * by the capitals rather than by the line box.
 *
 * One component, so the landing, the gate sign, the footer and the splash
 * all draw the same thing. Its size is the mark's, set in CSS as `--mark`
 * (see `.sa-wordmark`), so a narrow screen scales the whole of it rather
 * than squeezing one half.
