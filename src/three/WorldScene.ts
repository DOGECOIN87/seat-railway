    /* Roll it by hand — and where that roll goes depends on where the camera
       is standing, because "the aeroplane is inverted" is two different
       pictures from two different places.

       From outside, it goes on the airframe alone. The exterior camera is a
       child of `aircraft`, so it rides the airframe: bank the whole group and
       the aeroplane sits still in frame while the horizon turns — which is
       what flying alongside something actually looks like, and exactly wrong
       for a switch labelled "invert". Rolling the model instead, which the
       camera is a sibling of rather than a passenger in, leaves the horizon
       where it was and turns the aeroplane over in front of it.

       From inside it goes on the camera, below, and the first attempt at that
       got it wrong in an instructive way. Rolling the whole `aircraft` group
       is what a passenger would actually experience — they go over *with* the
       cabin, so the seat in front is still in front and the only thing that
       changes is out of the window — and it is very nearly invisible: the
       cabin renders identically and the one thing that moves is a hand-sized
       rectangle of ground. Correct, and nobody would notice. Rolling the
       camera turns the whole shot over instead: the seat backs swing above
       the viewer, the ceiling comes up from below, and the ground still ends
       up over the sky outside.

       The market's own bank is deliberately not treated this way and stays on
       the group, which is why `useAttitude` keeps `bank` and `roll` apart: a
       two-degree lean should tilt the horizon past the window, not tip the
       furniture.

       Eased in `useAttitude` rather than here, so the horizon out of the
       cockpit and the lean of the hold — neither of which is a three.js
       scene — go over on exactly the same curve. */
    /* From outside, the bank goes on the model too — for the same reason
       the hand-flown roll always has. The exterior camera rides the
       aircraft group, so banking the group banked the camera with it: the
       aeroplane sat level in frame and only the horizon tilted, usually out
       of shot, and nobody could see the turn. With the group held level
       from out here, the wings visibly tip into every turn. */
    /* The secondary motions of a turn, seen from outside. The camera flying
       alongside cannot match a turn instantly, so it follows the heading
       about three seconds behind: the nose visibly swings into the turn,
       then settles as the camera catches up on the roll-out. And a banked
       wing lifts less, so the nose comes up a couple of degrees to hold the
       height — what the elevators have been showing all along. Both turn
       the model about its wing box rather than its nose, so it rotates in
       place instead of sliding across the frame. */
