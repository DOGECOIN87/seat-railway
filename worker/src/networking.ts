 * the roster, sends a note, reads their replies. A wallet popup per action
 * would make the hub unusable, and people who are asked to sign constantly
 * stop reading what they sign.
 *
 * So the wallet signs once, for a session: the signature proves the key, and
 * what comes back is a bearer token good for a day. The token is stored here
 * only as a SHA-256 of itself, so this table cannot be read back into
 * anybody's account.

   a card is always `https://x.com/<handle>` and never whatever somebody

   link to, so it is kept as text, and only an invite is kept as a link, and
