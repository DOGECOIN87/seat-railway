/**
 * The advert server, and the cabin directory.
 *
 * The wall, keyed by wallet:
 *
 *   GET  /banners   the published wall, keyed by wallet
 *   POST /banner    put an advert up, if you can prove the wallet is yours
 *   GET  /holders   who is aboard, and the supply their bags are shares of
 *   GET  /holding   one wallet's balance, so no page has to carry an RPC key
 *   GET  /flight    what the aeroplane is being told to do, if anything
 *   PUT  /flight    tell it — the flight deck only
 *
 * The directory, behind a session that same wallet signature opens:
 *
 *   POST   /session    prove the key, get a bearer token for a day
 *   DELETE /session    hand it back
 *   GET    /directory  every published card
 *   PUT    /profile    publish or amend your own
 *   GET    /messages   your introductions, both directions
 *   POST   /messages   send one, to your own section or one behind it
 *
 * And one route that is nobody's but the operator's:
 *
 *   GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /logbook   one wallet's private notes
 *
 * It answers 404 to everybody else — the same 404 as a misspelt path, byte
 * for byte — because a 403 tells whoever asked that there is something there
 * to be refused. See its own section below.
 *
 * ── What this service knows about seats ───────────────────────────────────
 * For the wall, nothing, and it needs nothing: an advert is stored against
 * the wallet that published it and the page decides where it hangs. That
 * leaves the wall exactly one question — is this request really from the
 * wallet it names? — and the first half of this file answers it.
 *
 * For the directory that is not enough. "Your own section and everything
 * behind it" is a rule about who may read somebody's email address and who
 * may write into their inbox, and a rule enforced in the browser is a
 * suggestion the network tab ignores. So this side works the seating out as
 * well. Not a second copy of it — the drift that would cause is what the
 * refusal was always about — but the page's own module, imported from
 * `src/lib/seating.ts` and fed the page's own holder feed by `ladder.ts`.

/* ── The logbook's table ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Made here, by the Worker, rather than by a migration in CI — and that is a
   concession rather than a preference, so it is worth saying why.

   `wrangler d1 migrations apply` needs an API token with *D1: Edit*. The
   token this repository deploys with has Workers, KV and R2 and not that, so
   the migration step failed with a 7403 and took the deploy down with it:
   schema before code works only when you can write the schema. Granting the
   token D1 costs a trip to the Cloudflare dashboard, which the operator of
   this deployment does not currently have.

   A *binding* is not an API token. At runtime `env.DIRECTORY` speaks to the
   database directly with no token in the path at all, so the one thing CI
   cannot do, the Worker can — and `migrations/0002_logbook.sql` stays as the
   schema's written record and as what `--local` applies for the route suite.

   Once per isolate, on the operator's first logbook request and never on
   anybody else's: the call sits after the admin check, so a stranger's 404
   costs nothing and no unauthenticated request can make this service write
   DDL. A failure clears the latch rather than caching itself, because a
   database that was briefly unreachable should not leave the logbook broken
   until the next deploy.

   This does not generalise. One table, two statements, both `IF NOT EXISTS`.

/* ── The cabin directory ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Profiles and introductions, in SQL, because they are rows: one card per
   wallet, and messages read back by recipient and by sender.

   This service used not to know which seat anybody was in, and this comment
   used to say so: the page decided that, as it does for adverts, and the
   section perks were the page's reading of a manifest it already held. That
   is no longer true, because a perk that is only the page's reading is one
   the network tab helps itself to. The seating is worked out on this side as
   well — from the page's own module rather than a second copy of it — and
   the perks are decided where the rows are.

   The lines this service draws:

     · Nothing here is readable without a session, and a session is only
       opened by a wallet that proved its key *and* holds the token. The
       directory is a room for holders because a non-holder never gets a
       token to ask with. (`holdsToken` stands aside when it cannot reach the
       RPC to find out — see its own note on why that is the honest failure.)
     · Inside that room the cabin decides the rest, and it is transparent
       looking aft and opaque looking forward: contact details go to your own
       section and everything behind it, conversations are readable by the
       two wallets on them and by any section ahead of both. `ladder.ts` says
       how this side comes to know which is which without keeping a second
       copy of the seating.
     · An introduction goes wherever a card can be read — your own section
       and every seated one behind it — and nowhere forward. So a card you can
       read is a card you can answer, and the further forward somebody sits
       the fewer people can write to them at all. The flight deck's inbox
       reaches only the flight deck. */

       It used to, and that is why `VITE_RPC_URL` existed. Vite inlines every
       VITE_ value into the bundle it ships, so an endpoint carrying an API
       key — which is what a paid RPC is — was readable by anyone who opened
       the site. The documented defence was to restrict the key by domain at
       the provider, and that defence is the `Origin` header: a string anybody
       with curl can type. It stops a copy-paste, not a script.

       The key lives here instead, where it is a Worker secret and never
       leaves. What the browser gets is this: a balance, a supply, and a
       share, all of them public on-chain facts about a wallet the page is
       already drawing on a seat map.

       It is also cheaper by the same argument as `/holders`. One reload of
       the page is no longer one RPC call; a hundred visitors are not a
       hundred callers of somebody's metered endpoint.

       A failure answers 503 rather than a zero balance. Telling a holder
       they hold nothing because an endpoint was busy would reseat them into

       The aircraft flies the market: pitch, bank, speed and altitude are all
       read off the chart, on every visitor's page, from the same number.
       These are the switches that take hold of it — invert, barrel roll, a
       camera turntable, flaps, the hour, the weather — and they are read by
       *everybody*, which is the entire reason they live here rather than in
       one browser's storage. An aeroplane only one person can see upside
       down is a screensaver. This is a flight everybody is on.

       So `GET` is public and unauthenticated, like the wall and the holder
       list, and `PUT` belongs to the wallet named in `ADMIN_WALLET` — the
       same one the logbook belongs to. That one refuses with a 403 rather
       than the logbook's 404, and the difference is deliberate: the logbook
       is hidden, and this is not. Every visitor watching the aeroplane roll
       already knows somebody rolled it.

       Nothing in here can hurt anybody. It is an attitude, a camera rate and
       a sky — no balances, no addresses, nothing written anywhere else — and

         A session lasts a day, and a bag can be gone in a minute. Most of

         of: drop off the manifest and the ladder puts you in the hold within
         its cache, so contact details close, conversations stop carrying,
         and no introduction will send. But the door itself was checked once,
         at sign-in, and never again — so a wallet that sold everything kept
         the roster for up to twenty-four hours, and the roster is most of
         what the room is for.

         So the door's own check is made again here, against the same cache
         that keeps it from being an RPC call per request. It stands aside
         when the chain cannot answer, exactly as it does at sign-in — an
         outage should not empty the cabin — and when it does answer no, the
         session row goes too, so the page is told to sign in again rather
         than left retrying a token that will never work again.

         Being out-held is not selling. A holder who still holds anything
         keeps their session, their card, and their inbox; they are in the
         hold, which is part of this aeroplane.
